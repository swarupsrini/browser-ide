This is a testing ground for the [Rust Code Server](https://github.com/JaLnYn/websocket-ide) 🍌

## Features

- 💻 It edits code!
- 🎨 LSP features (You'll have to look at it from the console 🙃)
- 📁 File explorer that actually updates in real-time
- ⚡ Fast enough™

## Tech Stack

- React (Hooks & Context)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components (making it 10% prettier)
- WebSocket (for chatting with the server)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Make sure you have the [Rust Code Server](https://github.com/JaLnYn/browser-ide) running, or you'll just be staring at a blank screen!

This is my testing playground, but if you want to make it less ugly or more functional, be my guest!
